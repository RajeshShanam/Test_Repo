Hello Team, 

We have taken rental truck from budget with  reservation number  **** at bloomington minnsota location and drop off at dallas Texas. While coming from Bloomington to Dallas our truct two tires got flatted and we have waited for more than 3 days to get it repaired. during that 3 days I have called plenty of times to customer service to arrange a replacement truct but budget did not arranged a replacement truct instead they told me to stay in near by hotel and budget will reimberse my hotel, food expenses of me and wife and compensation for not using the truck for 3 days. due to this budget  inconvirnece I had to cancel all my work for that 3 days and lost my income.

I urge you to please help me in reimburse for my 3 days hotel, towing  and food expenses and compensation for not using the truck for 3 days. 

Attched hotel and towing receipts where I stayed and for food we spent more tham $ 300 dollars.

Please give me a call on +1 203-993-9647 if you have any questions in this regards.
