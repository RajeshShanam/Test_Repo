  - `actions/checkout` retrieves the latest commit with full history.

---

### Slide 8: Step 2 - Set npm Registry
- **NPM Registry Configuration:**
  - Configures npm to use a specific internal registry for package installations.
  - Sets the `SF_NPM_REGISTRY` environment variable.

---

### Slide 9: Step 3 - Install Salesforce CLI

---

### Slide 14: Step 8 - Check-only Deploy
- **Check-only Deployment:**
  - Deploys only the changes and runs the specified tests if they exist.
  - Uses the `RunSpecifiedTests` test level for targeted testing.

---

### Slide 15: Step 9 - SARIF Code Scanning
- **Code Scanning:**
  - Scans the code in the delta directory using the SFDX scanner.
  - Generates a SARIF file for the scan results.

---

### Slide 16: Step 10 - Upload SARIF File
- **Upload SARIF Results:**
  - Uses GitHubâ€™s CodeQL action to upload the SARIF file for visibility in the PR.

---
