### **Slide 4: Overview of GitHub Actions**
- **What is GitHub Actions?**
  - GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool for automating workflows within GitHub repositories.
  - Key features include:
    - **Triggers** (e.g., on `push`, `pull_request`, or scheduled events).
    - **Jobs and Steps**: Jobs are executed sequentially or in parallel, with steps defining individual tasks (like deploying or running tests).
  - **Why Use GitHub Actions for Salesforce**:
    - Native GitHub integration.
    - Flexibility in creating custom workflows for different Salesforce environments.

### **Slide 5: Steps to Implement Salesforce DevOps Pipeline with GitHub Actions**
#### **Step 1: Set up a Salesforce Project Repository**
- **Create a GitHub Repository**: Set up the repository to store Salesforce metadata (source format) and code.
- **Organize Metadata**: Use Salesforce DX (SFDX) for organizing metadata in a source-driven development model.
- **Create GitHub Branching Strategy**:
  - Feature branches for development.
  - A main branch for production-ready code.

#### **Step 2: Prepare Salesforce CLI (SFDX)**
- **Install Salesforce CLI** locally or in your CI/CD environment.
- Ensure that the following commands are available in the pipeline:
  - **Authenticate with Salesforce** using JWT or OAuth flow.
  - **Metadata Push/Deploy**: `sfdx force:source:deploy` or `sfdx force:source:push`.
  - **Run Apex Tests**: `sfdx force:apex:test:run`.

#### **Step 3: Set Up GitHub Secrets for Secure Authentication**
- **Store Salesforce Authentication Secrets** in GitHub:
  - Add `SF_AUTH_URL`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` as GitHub secrets to securely authenticate with your Salesforce orgs.

### **Slide 6: Salesforce DevOps Workflow Configuration**
- **Workflow Definition**:
  - **Create `.github/workflows/salesforce-ci.yml`** file to define the pipeline.
  
- **Sample Pipeline**:  
  ```yaml
  name: Salesforce CI

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - feature/*

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Install Salesforce CLI
          run: |
            npm install sfdx-cli --global
        
        - name: Authenticate with Salesforce
          run: |
            echo ${{ secrets.SF_AUTH_URL }} | sfdx force:auth:sfdxurl:store -f -
        
        - name: Create Scratch Org
          run: |
            sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a TestOrg -s
        
        - name: Push Source to Scratch Org
          run: sfdx force:source:push -u TestOrg
        
        - name: Run Apex Tests
          run: sfdx force:apex:test:run -u TestOrg --resultformat junit --outputdir test-results
        
        - name: Delete Scratch Org
          if: always()
          run: sfdx force:org:delete -u TestOrg --noprompt
  ```

### **Slide 7: Detailed Breakdown of the GitHub Actions Pipeline**
- **Triggering Events**:
  - Workflow triggers on commits to `main` and pull requests to `feature/*` branches.
  
- **Pipeline Steps**:
  1. **Checkout Code**: Clones the repository.
  2. **Install Salesforce CLI**: Installs Salesforce CLI for deployment and testing.
  3. **Authentication**: Uses secure Salesforce org credentials.
  4. **Scratch Org Creation**: Creates a temporary org for testing purposes.
  5. **Push Metadata**: Deploys Salesforce metadata from the repo to the scratch org.
  6. **Run Apex Tests**: Executes automated tests to validate changes.
  7. **Clean Up**: Deletes the scratch org after use to minimize resource consumption.

### **Slide 8: Deployment to Sandbox/Production Environments**
#### **Step 4: Create Environment-Specific Workflows**
- **Create Separate Workflows for Sandbox and Production Deployments**:
  - Define separate GitHub Action YAML files for each environment:
    - `sandbox-deploy.yml`: For deployment to sandbox environments.
    - `prod-deploy.yml`: For production releases.
  
- **Sample Sandbox Deployment Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  name: Salesforce Sandbox Deployment

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
        - name: Install Salesforce CLI
          run: npm install sfdx-cli --global
        
        - name: Authenticate with Salesforce
          run: echo ${{ secrets.SF_SANDBOX_AUTH_URL }} | sfdx force:auth:sfdxurl:store -f -
        
        - name: Deploy to Sandbox
          run: sfdx force:source:deploy -u SandboxOrg --sourcepath force-app
  ```

### **Slide 9: Best Practices for Salesforce DevOps Pipelines**
- **Key Tips**:
  1. **Use GitHub Secrets** to securely store credentials and sensitive information.
  2. **Automate Testing**: Include both Apex and LWC tests in the pipeline.
  3. **Monitor and Fail Early**: Fail fast on errors to prevent faulty code from advancing through the pipeline.
  4. **Separate Pipelines** for development, QA, and production environments.
  5. **Automated Code Quality Checks**: Use PMD or SonarQube for static code analysis.

  1. Trigger a pipeline using GitHub Actions.
  2. Walk through the logs to explain the deployment and test execution process.
  3. Show how the pipeline progresses from code push to deployment and test feedback.
