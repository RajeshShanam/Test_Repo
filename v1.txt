### **Slide 4: Introduction to GitHub Actions**
- **Key Points**:
  - **What is GitHub Actions?**
    - GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool provided by GitHub to automate workflows.
  - **How it Works**:
    - **Workflows**: Automated processes defined in YAML.
    - **Triggers**: Events that trigger actions (e.g., code commits, pull requests).
    - **Actions**: Tasks executed as part of the workflow.
  - **Why GitHub Actions for Salesforce**:
    - Native GitHub integration.
    - Community-contributed actions.
    - Flexible and customizable.

---

### **Slide 5: Key Salesforce DevOps Pipeline Requirements**
- **Key Points**:
  1. **Version Control with Git**:
      - Track metadata and configuration changes.
  2. **Automated Testing**:
      - Apex tests, UI tests (Selenium, Provar).
  3. **Metadata Deployments**:
      - Salesforce CLI (`sfdx force:source:deploy`).
  4. **Environment Management**:
      - Sandbox management, scratch org creation.
  5. **Static Code Analysis**:
      - Ensure code quality with tools like PMD and ESLint.

---

### **Slide 6: GitHub Actions Workflow for Salesforce**
- **Key Points**:
  - **Workflow Structure**:
    - Define YAML configuration in `.github/workflows/`.
    - Trigger workflows on code commit, PR, or schedule.
  - **Sample Workflow Overview**:
    - **Event Triggers**: e.g., pull request or push to a feature branch.
    - **Build Jobs**:
      1. **Checkout Code**: `actions/checkout@v2`
      2. **Install Salesforce CLI**: `Install sfdx cli`
      3. **Create Scratch Org**: `sfdx force:org:create`
      4. **Deploy Metadata**: `sfdx force:source:deploy`
      5. **Run Apex Tests**: `sfdx force:apex:test:run`
    - **Outcome**: Validate metadata deployment and run tests in isolated scratch orgs.

### **Slide 7: Sample GitHub Actions YAML File**
```yaml
name: Salesforce CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - feature/*

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Install Salesforce CLI
        run: |
          npm install sfdx-cli --global
        
      - name: Authenticate with Salesforce
        run: |
          echo ${{ secrets.SF_AUTH_URL }} | sfdx force:auth:sfdxurl:store -f -
        
      - name: Create Scratch Org
        run: |
          sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a MyScratchOrg
        
      - name: Push Metadata
        run: |
          sfdx force:source:push -u MyScratchOrg
        
      - name: Run Apex Tests
        run: |
          sfdx force:apex:test:run -u MyScratchOrg --resultformat junit --outputdir test-results
          
      - name: Delete Scratch Org
        if: always()
        run: sfdx force:org:delete -u MyScratchOrg --noprompt
```

### **Slide 8: Detailed Breakdown of YAML**
- **Triggering Events**:
  - Commits and Pull Requests to the `main` or `feature/*` branches.
- **Job Steps**:
  1. **Checkout**: Pulls code from GitHub.
  2. **Install Salesforce CLI**: Ensures Salesforce CLI is available.
  3. **Authenticate**: Uses GitHub secrets for secure authentication.
  4. **Scratch Org Creation**: Temporary environment for isolated testing.
  5. **Deploy Code**: Push Salesforce metadata into the scratch org.
  6. **Run Tests**: Automated testing to validate code and metadata.
  7. **Cleanup**: Deletes scratch org after tests.

---

### **Slide 9: Key Salesforce DevOps Tools in GitHub Actions**
- **Key Tools**:
  - **Salesforce CLI (SFDX)**: Core CLI for deployments, org management, testing.
  - **PMD for Static Code Analysis**: Code quality and best practices.
  - **Jest for Lightning Web Component (LWC) Testing**: Unit testing for LWCs.
  - **GitHub Secrets**: Secure management of credentials (SF Auth URL).

---

### **Slide 10: Demo: GitHub Actions in Action**
- **Live Demonstration** (if possible):
  1. Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow on a code commit.
  2. View logs of each step.
  3. Show Apex test results and deployment summary.

---

### **Slide 11: Best Practices for Salesforce DevOps with GitHub Actions**
- **Key Tips**:
  1. **Use GitHub Secrets** for sensitive data (e.g., Salesforce auth tokens).
  2. **Create Separate Workflows** for different pipelines (e.g., QA, Production).
  3. **Automate Code Quality Checks** with PMD and static code analysis tools.
  4. **Modularize Workflows**: Break large workflows into smaller, reusable jobs.
  5. **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines**: Use alerts and dashboards for failed jobs.

---

### **Slide 12: Conclusion**
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - GitHub Actions streamlines Salesforce DevOps.
  - Continuous Integration and Deployment improve release cycles and code quality.
  - Best practices ensure smooth automation and efficient teamwork.
